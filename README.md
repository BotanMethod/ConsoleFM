# ConsoleFM
**This is a Console File Manager based on ConsoleOS**

## Before using Console FM, follow that step:
* Make sure that these libraries are installed to work:
  - `os`
  - `subprocess`
  - `getpass`
  - `cmd`
  - `shutil`
  - `time`

**Congratulations!** 
If you followed that step, then you can use ConsoleFM without any problems.

## WARNING! 
Since ConsoleFM is based on the ConsoleOS kernel, an error occurs in it related to the incorrect operation of programs like ConsoleOS on Linux operating systems. At the moment (10/26/2024) I am trying to fix the bug, and for about a couple of months I will try to release versions of ConsoleOS and ConsoleFM for Linux, but this is not accurate, since I will probably be busy developing ConsoleOS and ConsoleFM for Windows and I have never used Linux.
